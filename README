WHAT IS IT?
===========
SliceAndDaid is a 3D slicer written in Java. It's a faster replacement
for skeinforge.

It processes STL input files into GCode. Or atleast, it will at some point.
Right now it just slices the model into lines, creates an outline.

The next step will be to create the GCode for those outlines.

It currently does so in seconds instead of minutes compared to Skeinforge.
