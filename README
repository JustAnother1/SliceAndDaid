WHAT IS IT?
===========
SliceAndDaid is a 3D slicer written in Java. It's a much faster replacement
for skeinforge.

It processes STL input files into GCode. Right now it only creates the outline.
It does NOT do infills yet. Which will be the next step.

However, it currently does so in seconds instead of minutes compared to Skeinforge.

HOW TO BUILD?
=============
I've provided a simple ant build script.
So running with ant installed should be a simple:
$ ant
$ java -jar SliceAndDaid.jar

There are no extra dependences, just java. Eclipse project files are also supplied.

HOW TO USE?
===========
Change the settings you want, and slice ahead. The default settings should work
on an Ultimaker. These settings are conservative.
